    'story' : '''Once upon a time in the vast jungles of India, lived a rat. I mean, a lot of rats lived in the forest but this story is about one particularly mischievous and adventurous rat. So, let’s pay attention on or main character, the rat. 
On a fine evening, under the shade of the ever - present trees in the jungle, the mouse roamed around without a care in the world. To him, life was very simple yet boring, find food, eat said food (also where could he find cheese in this god forsaken forest, there were only insects and grass), and then go to sleep. 
To spend 24 hours in a day completing this monotonic life cycle frustrated him. The mouse wanted to be a hero, an adventurer, thankfully he hadn’t seen Ratatouille or he might have even wanted to be a chef. But you get the point, the mouse had all this fire in him, yet there was no target in sight. 
POV - Rat
“Ahhh, I am annoyed at this overly simple life of mine”,  I shouted at …, wait who was I even shouting at, god. Or what about the sky, which one looks more philosophical ??
Sky, it is.
Going on my merry way, complaining about life, trying to comprehend what my little self’s value was in this vast world. Maybe nothing, but I wanted to do something, experience new things. I had tried to go out of the forest you know, but it is SO big. I got lost.
“Fugg this”, I shouted at the pitiful tree in front of me. It was not the tree’s fault, maybe it was.
